# Amazon Cognito Identity SDK for JavaScript

**NOTE: We have discontinued developing this library as part of this GitHub repo. We will continue to develop it as part of the [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify/tree/master/packages/amazon-cognito-identity-js) GitHub repo. You can still reach us by creating an issue on the AWS Amplify GitHub repository or posting to the Amazon Cognito Identity forums. **
